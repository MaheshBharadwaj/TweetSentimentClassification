# Multi Class Tweet Sentiment Classification
This repository presents two approaches to classify tweets into 5 classes based on their sentiment:
 - Extremely Negative
 - Negative
 - Neutral
 - Positive
 - Extremely Positive

It is recommended to run the [code](Code.ipynb) in a GPU backend with ~15Gb VRAM.

## Dataset
The dataset is available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-analysis-ssn/)

## Approaches Used:
 - [Transformer model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762v5.pdf)
 - [Bi-directional Encoder Representations (BERT)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf) 

 Please refer to the [report](Report.pdf) for further information on the preprocessing procedures used and results obtained.
